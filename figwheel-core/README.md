## figwheel-core

Contains the core functionality of Figwheel.

This allows you to get the benefits of figwheel's hot reloading and
feedback cycle without being complected with a server or a REPL
implementation.

This is currently a work in progress.

This has reached the feature complete state but still requires some
time to reflect, refactor and document. This will take some time as it
will be informed by the development of two other new projects
`figwheel-repl` and possibly `figwheel-main`

# Usage

Experts only at this point

Add `figwheel-core` to your deps and then:

```
clj -m cljs.main -w src -e "(require '[figwheel.core :include-macros true])(figwheel.core/hook-cljs-build)(figwheel.core/start-from-repl)" -r
```
